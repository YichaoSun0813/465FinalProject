The Final Project for Fullstack 465 Portland State

install these dependencies:
-node
-create-react-app
-express
-cors
-mongoose
-dotenv
-nodemon
-react-router-dom
-bootstrap
-axios


once downloaded and have dependencies installed move to the backend
folder and start the DB server with 'server start'

next move out of the backend folder and start the frontend server with 'npm start'

the site should automatically pop-up but if not it can be found on localhost:3000



I used a tutorial to figure out how to set up a MongoDB database in a MERN stack and 
that tutorial can be found here:

Thanks to Beau Carnes for getting me started!
